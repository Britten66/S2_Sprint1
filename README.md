Overview Here

This project was developed during Sprint 1 (Winter 2025) as part of the Software Development Program at Keyin College.

Our goal was to build a clean, responsive multi-page website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The focus was on creating a visually appealing layout, adding interactivity through JavaScript, and ensuring the site works smoothly across different devices.
